### TO BE CONSIDERED

Kellee Santiago’s 10 steps

1. "We have to assess the realities of the time space continuum”.
3. Look at the calendar of events. You can sort of use submission to competitions as milestones, as an indie. 
4. What are the biggest unknowns? 
9. Re-evaluate the schedule regularly. You have to keep having conversations about your schedule. 
10. Maintain a stable build. Vertical Slice sprints can help with that.
